# TAGM_TW usage
This plugin and scripts are designed to provide basic, initial timing and 
timewalk calibrations for the tagger microscope. Once all steps are 
complete, each TAGM channel should be aligned with the RF in both the 
TDC and ADC.

To fully align the TAGM with the rest of the detectors, use HLDetectorTiming.

**CCDB version 1.06 or greater is needed for timing.py to work.**

## Running TAGM_TW
When running `hd_root` with the **TAGM_TW** plugin, make sure to include 
the option `-PTAGMHit:DELTA_T_ADC_TDC_MAX=200` in order to pick up any 
large offsets.

`hd_root -PPLUGINS=TAGM_TW -PTAGMHit:DELTA_T_ADC_TDC_MAX=200 /path/to/file/hd_rawdata_XXXXXX_00*`

Be aware that the CCDB table /PHOTON_BEAM/microscope/integral_cuts can 
interfere with the pulse height distributions. To set these values to 0 
on the fly, run with the option -PTAGMHit:CUT_FACTOR=0.

Also, be aware that the reference RF source for this plugin is the TAGH. 
Make sure that the TAGH RF signal is calibrated before proceeding.

Follow these steps after running `hd_root`. 

## Initial ADC-RF and raw TDC-ADC calibration
This is the first step to calibrate the TAGM. Because the ADC is already 
timewalk corrected, this can be immediately aligned with an RF bucket. 
At the same time, the uncorrected TDC time can be adjusted to be aligned 
with the new ADC time. This is a rough calibration of the raw TDC time 
which will avoid the timewalk from absorbing large offsets.

**For this step, it is important to include -PTAGMHit:DELTA_T_ADC_TDC_MAX=200
when running TAGM_TW. Occasionally, the initial time difference is very large.**

1. `python timing.py -b <rootfile> <run number> rf <CCDB variation>`
2. `This produces the file adc_offsets-######.txt and tdc_offsets-######.txt`
3. `./push-to-ccdb.sh <run number> <variation> adc tdc`
or
3. `ccdb add PHOTON_BEAM/microscope/fadc_time_offsets -v <variation> -r #-# adc_offsets-######.txt`
4. `ccdb add PHOTON_BEAM/microscope/tdc_time_offsets -v <variation> -r #-# tdc_offsets-######.txt`

## Timewalk corrections
The timewalk corrections are to be performed after the initial ADC-RF and 
raw TDC-ADC calibrations have been performed.

The timewalk plugin uses the TAGH RF as a reference. For a given hit, the 
RF time closest to the ADC time is selected and set as the RF time. The time 
difference between the TDC time and the RF time is taken. By doing it this 
way, there are not multiple timewalk distributions every beam period. This 
allows for large timewalks to be included in the fit.

**The constants from the previous step must be pushed to the CCDB and a new root
file created using TAGM_TW before performing this step.**

1. `python tw.py -b <rootfile> <run number>`
2. `This creates the files results.root and tw-corr.txt`
3. `root -l -b 'display.C("results.root")' to check the fits`
4. `./push-to-ccdb.sh <run number> <variation> tw`
or
4. `ccdb add /PHOTON_BEAM/microscope/tdc_timewalk_corrections -v <variation> -r #-# tw-corr.txt`

## Corrected TDC-RF calibration
At this point, the previous steps should be completed and verified. The 
ADC-RF distribution should be centered at 0 as well as the raw TDC-ADC.

This step takes the timewalk corrected TDC time and compares it with the ADC. 
Since the ADC is already aligned with the RF, this will align the TDC with 
both.

**The constants from the previous step must be pushed to the CCDB and a new root
file created using TAGM_TW before performing this step.**

1. `python timing.py -b <rootfile> <run number> self <CCDB variation>`
2. `This overwrites the previous tdc_offsets-#####.txt file`
3. `./push-to-ccdb.sh <run number> <variation> tdc`
or
3. `ccdb add PHOTON_BEAM/microscope/tdc_time_offsets -v <variation> -r #-# tdc_offsets-######.txt`

## Calibration validation
After all steps are complete, a calibration validation can be performed. Run 
the plugin again with the new constants.

**The constants from the previous step must be pushed to the CCDB and a new root
file created using TAGM_TW before performing this step.**

1. `python timing.py -b <rootfile> <run number> validate <CCDB variation>`
2. `This produces a file problem-channels.txt containing any errors or fits 
that are exceeding a default value. These channels should be investigated.`

## Timing resolutions
Once all of the calibrations are done, the timing resolutions can be measured. 
The timing.py script will look at the corrected TDC-RF plots and fit the 
distributions with a Gaussian. The results are provided as 1 sigma as well as 
FWHM and can be seen in the ROOT file resolutions.root.

1. `python timing.py -b <rootfile> <run number> res <CCDB variation>`
