This plugin can can apply an efficiency to specific regions of specific detectors.
The intended purpose is it generate plots indicating problems so we can use them
to try the hydra models for DQM AI.

The map of which CDC straws belong to which board are in the CDC_pins_spacedelim.txt.
The script cdc_pins2c++.py reads this file and generates C++ code in the file
CDC_pins.h. This is not done by the build system since the original file is never
expected to change. The original file and code generator script are kept here though
to record the method by which CDC_pins.h was generated.
